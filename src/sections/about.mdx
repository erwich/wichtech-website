## About Me

> Parenthood and programming, powered by caffeine.

I am an avid programmer, working full time as a Software Applications Developer and spending as much of my free time as I can learning cool new stuff. I'm also passionate about music; you can find me jamming with the Worship Team at [TFMC Church](https://tfmchurch.com) every Sunday. Above all, I am a husband and father of two beautiful daughters striving to put Christ in the center of it all.
